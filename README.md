Hyperlapse
==========

This is the code for my final project for [Computational Photography with Prof. Connelly Barnes](http://www.connellybarnes.com/work/class/2014/comp_photo/).

This code requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FFmpeg

To run the code, first, open hyperlapse.py and define the input and output paths for the video (the variables INPUT_VIDEO_PATH and OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH) in the "globals" section at the top of the file. Additionally in the "globals" section, the user can define other parameters such as how much to speed the video up by (variable SPEED_UP) and the output video codec (variable FOURCC).

Once these parameters have been set, run in the command line: 

     python hyperlapse.py

Example outputs from the program are available here: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/sam_bot5/sets/72157649640891046](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sam_bot5/sets/72157649640891046)

You can feel free to use this code for whatever you want, with the following stipulations:

1. This code cannot be used in any product that is sold
2. You must reference me if you use this code
3. If you're currently in the class, don't use this code to cheat.

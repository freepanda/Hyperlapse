This is the code for my final project for [Computational Photography with Prof. Connelly Barnes](http://www.connellybarnes.com/work/class/2014/comp_photo/).

This code requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FFmpeg

I plan to do a formal write-up about this on my blog, which I'll link to here when it's been written. Example outputs from the program are available here: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/sam_bot5/sets/72157649640891046](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sam_bot5/sets/72157649640891046)

You can feel free to use this code for whatever you want, with the following stipulations:

1. This code cannot be used in any product that is sold
2. You must reference me if you use this code
3. If you're currently in the class, don't use this code to cheat.
